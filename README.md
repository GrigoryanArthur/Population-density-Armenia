You can freely use this code for your own purposes. The only things you need is to have R installed, or some kind of IDE such as RStudio, or VSCode. 

I have created this code in RStudio and tested in VSCode and both have worked fine.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: This code have been created using the original code created by Spencer Schien, which is available here https://github.com/Pecners/kontur_rayshader_tutorial
